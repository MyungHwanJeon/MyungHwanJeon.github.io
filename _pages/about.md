I'm a postdoctoral researcher in [KIMLAB](https://publish.illinois.edu/kimlab2020/) at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Joohyung Kim](https://publish.illinois.edu/kimlab2020/). I'm focused on the research for spatial intelligence for mobile manipulation in human environments. Especially targeting efficient robot manipulation in human environments, I'm trying to solve spatial perception with various vision sensors. I'm also working on other related research projects for autonomous driving.

Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher in [RPM robotics Lab](https://rpm.snu.ac.kr) at [SNU](https://www.snu.ac.kr), advised by [Prof. Ayoung Kim](https://ayoungk.github.io/). I obtained Ph.D. degree in the [Robotics Program](https://robots.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/). My research topic during my Ph.D. had been focused on the vision-based 6D object pose estimation toward efficient robot manipulation, advised by Prof. Ayoung Kim. I also executed a lot of research projects related to the SLAM in the real-world, dealing with LiDAR-based methods, heterogeneous sensor-fusion, pose-graph optimization, etc.

I am interested in implementing embodied AI robots for real-world applications to help us all live better lives. Especially, I believe that proposing efficient and effective mobile manipulation could greatly benefit everyday life. I am eager to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of AI and robotics.
