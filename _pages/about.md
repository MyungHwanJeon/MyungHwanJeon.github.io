I'm an assistant professor in School of Electronic Engineering at [KIT](https://eng.kumoh.ac.kr/eng/). 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in [KIMLAB](https://publish.illinois.edu/kimlab2020/) at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Joohyung Kim](https://publish.illinois.edu/kimlab2020/). My research focused on visual perception for robot manipulation in human environments.

Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in [RPM robotics Lab](https://rpm.snu.ac.kr) at [SNU](https://www.snu.ac.kr), advised by [Prof. Ayoung Kim](https://ayoungk.github.io/). I obtained Ph.D. degree in the [Robotics Program](https://robots.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/). My research topic during my Ph.D. had been focused on the vision-based 6D object pose estimation toward efficient robot manipulation, advised by Prof. Ayoung Kim. I also executed a lot of research projects related to the SLAM in the real-world, dealing with LiDAR-based methods, heterogeneous sensor-fusion, pose-graph optimization, etc.

I am interested in implementing embodied Intelligence for real-world applications to help us all live better lives. Especially, I believe that proposing efficient and effective mobile manipulation could greatly benefit everyday life. I am eager to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of AI and robotics.
