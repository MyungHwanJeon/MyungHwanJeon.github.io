## Intro

Maritime radars are prevalently adopted to cap- ture the vesselâ€™s omnidirectional data as imagery. Neverthe- less, inherent challenges persist with marine radars, including limited frequency, suboptimal resolution, and indeterminate detections. Additionally, the scarcity of discernible landmarks in the vast marine expanses remains a challenge, resulting in consecutive scenes that often lack matching feature points. In this context, we introduce a resilient maritime radar scan representation LodeStar, and an enhanced feature extraction technique tailored for marine radar applications. Moreover, we embark on estimating marine radar odometry utilizing a semi- direct approach. LodeStar-based approach markedly attenuates the errors in odometry estimation, and our assertion is corrob- orated through meticulous experimental validation.
